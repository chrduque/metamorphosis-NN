## METaMorPHosis-NN: METallicity for M dwarfs using PHotometry and Neural Networks

This is the Python code to calculate the photometric metallicity estimations described in Duque-Arribas et al. (2025): (accepted for publication in A&A).

--- I will update this repository with the code in the following days.
